# Features
The intuitive user interface of the calculator allows you to enter the bill amount, specify the number of people involved, and quickly calculate the individual amounts each person should pay. You can also add custom tip percentages. 
In addition to splitting bills by total amount, the calculator also includes an option to split bills per item. This feature allows you to enter each item that was purchased and then allocate it to a specific person. This feature ensures that everyone pays only for what they owe, and that the final bill is split fairly.
